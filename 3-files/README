Brief summary:
	calc This is a simple command-line calculator program.
	echo This program is used to show contents of a file line by line.
	verify This is a simpler version of calc program.

How to build:
	In command-line, go to the folder where the source files are.
	using command
	$ make
	That's it.

How to use:
	For calc
	This program has two modes, console mode and file mode.
	In console mode, start with command like this
	$ ./calc
	Then type in the numbers line by line
	one numbers for one line
	when you are done, please press ctrl-d to terminate the program and you will get the final value.
	when you need to change the operator, use the operator commands as follows
	op +
	op -
	op *
	op /
	op %
	These are the only five operators supported.
	The result for last calculation is stored and will be used for the future calculation.

	For file mode, just type the numbers line by line in the input file
	when you need to change the operator, type the operator command in that line
	start use file mode like this
	$ ./calc <input file path>
	Then you can get the result.

	For multiple files, just add input file names as arguments. For example,
	$ ./calc input1.txt input2.txt <...>

	For echo
	This program only has one mode: file mode.
	$ ./echo <file path>

	For verify
	It's rather similar to calc

How to test:
	Test for all
	$ make mycheck

	Test for echo
	$ make mycheck-echo

	Test for verify
	$ make mycheck-verify

	Test for calc
	$ make mycheck-calc

	If you find a bug, please report to li.sanh@uwlax.edu

	For calc and verify
	The calculator program can only calculate the numbers within the double type boundaries. That means 1.79769e+308 ~ 2.22507e-308. Accuracy is 2^-15.
